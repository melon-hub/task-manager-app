### UX Polish & Feel: Implementation Plan

This section details a backlog of high-impact features focused on improving the application's "feel" and intuitive nature, inspired by best-in-class apps like Trello and Microsoft Planner.

#### Phase 1: Fluid Card & List Interactions (High Impact)
This phase focuses on making the core interactions of creating and manipulating cards feel seamless and satisfying.

- **[ ] Hover-to-reveal 'Add Card' button:**
  - **Description:** Instead of a persistent "Add Card" button at the bottom of a list, a subtle `+ Add a card` button should appear only when a user hovers in the space below the last card in a bucket. This is less intrusive and more contextual.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/board/Bucket.tsx`.
    - **Logic:** The `div` wrapping the bucket's content should become a `group`. The `Button` (or a new `div` that looks like a button) will have `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity` classes.
    - **Regression Guard:** This button will replace the logic that currently opens the `CreateCardDialog`, as this new pattern is for in-place creation.

- **[ ] "Quick Add" in-place card creation:**
  - **Description:** Clicking the `+ Add a card` button should transform it directly into a `textarea` for the card title and a "Save Card" button, avoiding a disruptive dialog. Pressing `Enter` saves the card and adds another "quick add" input below it for rapid, multi-card creation. Pressing `Escape` cancels the action.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/board/Bucket.tsx`.
    - **State:** Use local component state: `const [isAddingCard, setIsAddingCard] = useState(false)`.
    - **Logic:** When `isAddingCard` is true, render a `<form>` containing a `Textarea` and a `Button`. The `Textarea` should use `onKeyDown` to handle `Enter` (to submit the form) and `Escape` (to set `isAddingCard(false)`). The form's `onSubmit` handler will call the `createCard` store action.
    - **Data:** The `createCard` function must be called with `{ title, bucketId }`. The `bucketId` is available from the `Bucket.tsx` component's props.

- **[ ] Subtle hover animations on cards:**
  - **Description:** When a user hovers over a card, it should gently "lift" with a subtle `box-shadow` increase and a slight `transform: translateY(-2px)`. This makes the cards feel more tangible and interactive.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/board/CardItem.tsx`.
    - **Logic:** Add `transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out` and `hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-0.5` classes to the main wrapper `div` of the card.
    - **Regression Guard:** Ensure these classes do not interfere with the styles applied by `@dnd-kit` when `isDragging` is true. The `isDragging` styles should take precedence.

- **[ ] Visual drag-and-drop placeholder:**
  - **Description:** When dragging a card, the original space it occupied should show a dashed, semi-transparent placeholder. This gives the user a clear indicator of where the card came from and makes the board feel less jarring during moves.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/board/CardItem.tsx`.
    - **Library:** `@dnd-kit`.
    - **Logic:** The `useSortable` hook provides an `isDragging` boolean. Use this to conditionally apply classes to the card's wrapper `div`: `cn({ 'opacity-50 border-dashed bg-muted': isDragging })}`.
    - **Drag Overlay:** To perfect the effect, the `DragOverlay` component from `@dnd-kit` should be used in `BoardView.tsx` to render a visually identical, non-translucent copy of the `CardItem` that follows the cursor during the drag operation.

#### Phase 2: Keyboard Superpowers (High Impact for Power Users)
This phase is dedicated to making the app incredibly fast for keyboard-centric users.

- **[ ] Contextual keyboard shortcuts on cards:**
  - **Description:** When a card is "active" (e.g., clicked on), enable a suite of shortcuts: `e` to open the edit dialog, `l` for labels, `d` for due dates, `c` to complete/un-complete, and `Delete` for deletion (with an "Undo" toast).
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **State:** Add `activeCardId: string | null` to the `useBoardStore`, along with an action `setActiveCardId`.
    - **Activation:** In `CardItem.tsx`, add an `onClick` handler to the main card `div` that calls `setActiveCardId(card.id)`.
    - **Listener:** Add a `useEffect` in `BoardView.tsx` to add/remove a global `keydown` event listener.
    - **Visuals:** In `CardItem.tsx`, apply a visual indicator (e.g., a blue ring class like `ring-2 ring-blue-500`) when `useBoardStore(s => s.activeCardId) === card.id`.
    - **Regression Guard:** The event listener callback *must* check if the user is typing in an input to prevent shortcuts from firing incorrectly. Start the callback with: `if (e.target.tagName === 'INPUT' || e.target.tagName === 'TEXTAREA') return;`.

- **[ ] Global "Quick Add" shortcut:**
  - **Description:** Pressing `n` anywhere in the app should open the `CreateCardDialog`, pre-populating the board/bucket based on the current view or the most recently used.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `app/layout.tsx` is the best place for a truly global listener.
    - **Logic:** The listener will trigger a global state in a new `useUIStore` (to keep concerns separate) like `setCreateCardDialogOpen(true)`. The `CreateCardDialog` component will then listen to this state.
    - **Context:** To pre-populate, the `useBoardStore` should track the `lastViewedBucketId`. When navigating, this value should be updated. The `CreateCardDialog` can then use this ID.
    - **Regression Guard:** The global listener must also check `e.target` to avoid firing while in an input field.

- **[ ] Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`):**
  - **Description:** A power-user feature to quickly search for and navigate to any board, card, or setting.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **Library:** `cmdk` is the recommended library.
    - **Component:** Create a new `CommandPalette.tsx` component, rendered conditionally in `app/layout.tsx`.
    - **Data:** It will need to be populated with items from multiple Zustand stores: boards from `useBoardStore`, settings actions, etc. Each item will have a `name`, `action`, and `keywords`.

#### Phase 3: Smarter UI & Feedback (Medium Impact)
This phase focuses on small but crucial details that build user trust and make the app feel "smart".

- **[ ] Actionable "Undo" on delete:**
  - **Description:** When a card is deleted, instead of a confirmation dialog, immediately delete it from the UI and show a "toast" notification at the bottom of the screen: "Card deleted. [Undo]". Clicking "Undo" restores the card.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **Library:** `sonner` is recommended for its simplicity and built-in features.
    - **Store Logic:** The `deleteCard` action in `useBoardStore` should be modified. Instead of deleting, it moves the card to a `recentlyDeleted: Map<string, Card>`. It then calls `toast.success("Card deleted", { action: { label: "Undo", onClick: () => undoDelete(card.id) } })` and starts a `setTimeout` (e.g., 5 seconds).
    - **Cleanup:** The `setTimeout` callback will perform the permanent deletion from the Map and from IndexedDB. The `undoDelete` action cancels the timeout and moves the card back. This ensures atomicity.

- **[ ] Auto-save indicators in dialogs:**
  - **Description:** While a user is typing in the `EditCardDialog`, automatically save changes in the background. A subtle "Saving..." and then "Saved âœ“" text should appear in the dialog's footer to provide clear feedback. This eliminates the need for a "Save" button.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/board/EditCardDialog.tsx`.
    - **Logic:** Use a `useDebouncedCallback` hook (from a library like `use-debounce` or a custom implementation) inside a `useEffect` that tracks changes to the form fields.
    - **State:** Manage a local status: `const [saveStatus, setSaveStatus] = useState<'idle' | 'saving' | 'saved'>('idle')`.
    - **UI:** The debounced callback will set status to `'saving'`, call the `updateCard` store action, and then set status to `'saved'`. Render the status text in the `DialogFooter`.
    - **UX Refinement:** Once this is implemented, the main "Save" button in the form's footer can be removed, as it becomes redundant. The dialog's close button (`X`) will suffice for dismissal.
