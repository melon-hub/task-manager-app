### High Priority Improvements ðŸ”¥

#### 1. Dashboard Refactoring for Intuitive Use
- **Goal:** Transform the dashboard from a single, data-dense view into a focused, two-tab experience: an actionable to-do list ("My Tasks") and a powerful data overview ("Analytics & Insights").
- **Core Problem:** The current dashboard serves two conflicting purposes (personal action vs. project analysis), leading to clutter and a lack of clear direction for the user.
- **Solution:** Use a tabbed interface to separate these two contexts, with "My Tasks" as the default view.

- **[ ] Step 1: Create the Tabbed Layout**
  - **File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - **Library:** Use the `Tabs` component from `shadcn/ui`.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Create a `<Tabs defaultValue="my-tasks">` component at the top of the page.
    - Define two `<TabsTrigger>` components: one for "My Tasks" (`value="my-tasks"`) and one for "Analytics & Insights" (`value="analytics"`).
    - The existing filter bar (`Board`, `Date Range`, etc.) should be moved *inside* the "Analytics & Insights" tab content, as it's not relevant to the "My Tasks" view.

- **[ ] Step 2: Build the "My Tasks" View**
  - **Goal:** Provide a clean, scannable list of what the user needs to do now.
  - **Implementation:**
    1.  **Create New Component:** `src/components/dashboard/MyTasksView.tsx`.
    2.  **Data Fetching:** In this component, fetch all cards and filter them into three groups (assuming a "current user" context, which can be mocked for now):
        -   `Overdue & Due Today`: `!card.completed && card.dueDate <= today`
        -   `Upcoming (Next 7 Days)`: `!card.completed && card.dueDate > today && card.dueDate <= nextWeek`
        -   `No Due Date`: `!card.completed && !card.dueDate`
    3.  **Create List Item Component:** `src/components/dashboard/TaskListItem.tsx`. This component will display the card title, priority, its board/list name (e.g., "Project Phoenix / In Progress"), and the formatted due date. It should also have a `Checkbox` for quick completion.
    4.  **Layout:** Render the three lists, each with a clear heading. If a list is empty, show a congratulatory message (e.g., "ðŸŽ‰ No overdue tasks!").

- **[ ] Step 3: Refactor the "Analytics & Insights" View**
  - **Goal:** Move all existing analytics logic into its own self-contained component.
  - **Implementation:**
    1.  **Create New Component:** `src/components/dashboard/AnalyticsView.tsx`.
    2.  **Move Logic:** Cut almost all of the existing state management, filtering logic, and chart rendering from `app/dashboard/page.tsx` and paste it into `AnalyticsView.tsx`.
    3.  **Cleanup:** The `app/dashboard/page.tsx` file will become much simpler. It will primarily manage the tab state and render either `<MyTasksView />` or `<AnalyticsView />` inside the appropriate `<TabsContent>` block.

- **[ ] Step 4: Final Integration**
  - **File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - **Final Structure:**
    ```tsx
    <Tabs defaultValue="my-tasks">
      <TabsList>
        <TabsTrigger value="my-tasks">My Tasks</TabsTrigger>
        <TabsTrigger value="analytics">Analytics & Insights</TabsTrigger>
      </TabsList>
      <TabsContent value="my-tasks">
        <MyTasksView />
      </TabsContent>
      <TabsContent value="analytics">
        <AnalyticsView />
      </TabsContent>
    </Tabs>
    ```

### UX Polish & Feel: Implementation Plan

This section details a backlog of high-impact features focused on improving the application's "feel" and intuitive nature, inspired by best-in-class apps like Trello and Microsoft Planner.

#### Phase 1: Fluid Card & List Interactions (High Impact) âœ… COMPLETED
This phase focuses on making the core interactions of creating and manipulating cards feel seamless and satisfying.

- **[x] Hover-to-reveal 'Add Card' button:**
  - **Description:** Instead of a persistent "Add Card" button at the bottom of a list, a subtle `+ Add a card` button should appear only when a user hovers in the space below the last card in a bucket. This is less intrusive and more contextual.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/board/Bucket.tsx`.
    - **Logic:** The `div` wrapping the bucket's content should become a `group`. The `Button` (or a new `div` that looks like a button) will have `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity` classes.
    - **Regression Guard:** This button will replace the logic that currently opens the `CreateCardDialog`, as this new pattern is for in-place creation.

- **[x] "Quick Add" in-place card creation:**
  - **Description:** Clicking the `+ Add a card` button should transform it directly into a `textarea` for the card title and a "Save Card" button, avoiding a disruptive dialog. Pressing `Enter` saves the card and adds another "quick add" input below it for rapid, multi-card creation. Pressing `Escape` cancels the action.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/board/Bucket.tsx`.
    - **State:** Use local component state: `const [isAddingCard, setIsAddingCard] = useState(false)`.
    - **Logic:** When `isAddingCard` is true, render a `<form>` containing a `Textarea` and a `Button`. The `Textarea` should use `onKeyDown` to handle `Enter` (to submit the form) and `Escape` (to set `isAddingCard(false)`). The form's `onSubmit` handler will call the `createCard` store action.
    - **Data:** The `createCard` function must be called with `{ title, bucketId }`. The `bucketId` is available from the `Bucket.tsx` component's props.

- **[x] Subtle hover animations on cards:**
  - **Description:** When a user hovers over a card, it should gently "lift" with a subtle `box-shadow` increase and a slight `transform: translateY(-2px)`. This makes the cards feel more tangible and interactive.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/board/CardItem.tsx`.
    - **Logic:** Add `transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out` and `hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-0.5` classes to the main wrapper `div` of the card.
    - **Regression Guard:** Ensure these classes do not interfere with the styles applied by `@dnd-kit` when `isDragging` is true. The `isDragging` styles should take precedence.

- **[x] Visual drag-and-drop placeholder:**
  - **Description:** When dragging a card, the original space it occupied should show a dashed, semi-transparent placeholder. This gives the user a clear indicator of where the card came from and makes the board feel less jarring during moves.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/board/CardItem.tsx`.
    - **Library:** `@dnd-kit`.
    - **Logic:** The `useSortable` hook provides an `isDragging` boolean. Use this to conditionally apply classes to the card's wrapper `div`: `cn({ 'opacity-50 border-dashed bg-muted': isDragging })}`.
    - **Drag Overlay:** To perfect the effect, the `DragOverlay` component from `@dnd-kit` should be used in `BoardView.tsx` to render a visually identical, non-translucent copy of the `CardItem` that follows the cursor during the drag operation.

#### Phase 2: Keyboard Superpowers (High Impact for Power Users) âœ… COMPLETED
This phase is dedicated to making the app incredibly fast for keyboard-centric users.

- **[x] Contextual keyboard shortcuts on cards:**
  - **Description:** When hovering over a card, press `e` to open the edit dialog.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/board/CardItem.tsx`.
    - **Logic:** Uses a hover-based approach with `isHovered` state that triggers keyboard event listener.
    - **Regression Guard:** The event listener checks if the user is typing in an input/textarea to prevent shortcuts from firing incorrectly.

- **[x] Global "Quick Add" shortcut:**
  - **Description:** Pressing `n` anywhere in the app opens the `CreateCardDialog`, with context-aware list selection based on the currently hovered bucket.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/layout/GlobalShortcuts.tsx`.
    - **Logic:** The listener captures the `hoveredBucketId` at the moment `n` is pressed and passes it to CreateCardDialog.
    - **Context:** The `useBoardStore` tracks `hoveredBucketId` which is updated on bucket hover.
    - **Regression Guard:** The global listener checks `e.target` to avoid firing while in an input field.

- **[x] Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`):**
  - **Description:** A power-user feature to quickly search for and navigate to any board, card, or setting.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **Library:** `cmdk` library is used.
    - **Component:** `CommandPalette.tsx` component in `src/components/layout/`.
    - **Data:** Populated with boards from `useBoardStore`, allowing quick navigation.

#### Phase 3: Smarter UI & Feedback (Medium Impact)
This phase focuses on small but crucial details that build user trust and make the app feel "smart".

- **[x] Actionable "Undo" on delete:**
  - **Description:** When a card is deleted, instead of a confirmation dialog, immediately delete it from the UI and show a "toast" notification at the bottom of the screen: "Card deleted. [Undo]". Clicking "Undo" restores the card.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **Library:** `sonner` is recommended for its simplicity and built-in features.
    - **Store Logic:** The `deleteCard` action in `useBoardStore` should be modified. Instead of deleting, it moves the card to a `recentlyDeleted: Map<string, Card>`. It then calls `toast.success("Card deleted", { action: { label: "Undo", onClick: () => undoDelete(card.id) } })` and starts a `setTimeout` (e.g., 5 seconds).
    - **Cleanup:** The `setTimeout` callback will perform the permanent deletion from the Map and from IndexedDB. The `undoDelete` action cancels the timeout and moves the card back. This ensures atomicity.

- **[ ] Auto-save indicators in dialogs:**
  - **Description:** While a user is typing in the `EditCardDialog`, automatically save changes in the background. A subtle "Saving..." and then "Saved âœ“" text should appear in the dialog's footer to provide clear feedback. This eliminates the need for a "Save" button.
  - **Implementation Details:**
    - **File:** `src/components/board/EditCardDialog.tsx`.
    - **Logic:** Use a `useDebouncedCallback` hook (from a library like `use-debounce` or a custom implementation) inside a `useEffect` that tracks changes to the form fields.
    - **State:** Manage a local status: `const [saveStatus, setSaveStatus] = useState<'idle' | 'saving' | 'saved'>('idle')`.
    - **UI:** The debounced callback will set status to `'saving'`, call the `updateCard` store action, and then set status to `'saved'`. Render the status text in the `DialogFooter`.
    - **UX Refinement:** Once this is implemented, the main "Save" button in the form's footer can be removed, as it becomes redundant. The dialog's close button (`X`) will suffice for dismissal.

## Security Architecture & Implementation Plan

This plan outlines a phased approach to security, designed to evolve the application from its current local-first state to a secure, multi-user, cloud-enabled platform.

### Phase 1: Securing the Local-First Application (Current State)
This phase focuses on hardening the existing client-side application.

- **[ ] Input Sanitization:**
  - **Goal:** Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where malicious code could be injected into card titles, descriptions, etc.
  - **Implementation:** Before rendering any user-generated content (like card descriptions) that might contain HTML, use a library like `DOMPurify` to sanitize it. This strips out dangerous tags and attributes.
  - **Action:** `npm install dompurify && npm install -D @types/dompurify`. In components that render rich text, wrap the content: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(card.description) }}`.

- **[ ] Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:**
  - **Goal:** Continuously check for known vulnerabilities in third-party `npm` packages.
  - **Implementation:** Regularly run `npm audit`. Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline so it runs automatically on every push.
  - **Action:** Add a step to the future CI/CD workflow (e.g., in a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file) that executes `npm audit --audit-level=high`.

- **[ ] Content Security Policy (CSP):**
  - **Goal:** Define a whitelist of approved sources for content (scripts, styles, images), mitigating the risk of injection attacks.
  - **Implementation:** Use Next.js's built-in support for CSP headers. In `next.config.ts`, add a `headers` configuration to define a strict policy, allowing content only from your own domain and trusted third parties.

### Phase 2: Authentication - Adding User Sign-In
This phase introduces user accounts, a prerequisite for any cloud features.

- **[ ] Authentication Strategy: OAuth & Passwordless**
  - **Goal:** Provide secure, user-friendly sign-in without managing passwords directly.
  - **Recommendation:** Use **NextAuth.js** (`next-auth`). It is the de-facto standard for Next.js, is highly secure, and provides simple integration for many OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.).

- **[ ] Implementation Plan for Google Sign-In:**
  1.  **Install:** `npm install next-auth`.
  2.  **Setup Google OAuth Credentials:** Go to the Google Cloud Console, create a new project, and get an OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret. Add these to your environment variables (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`).
  3.  **Create API Route:** Create `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`. Configure it with the Google provider using the environment variables.
  4.  **Wrap App in `SessionProvider`:** In `app/layout.tsx`, wrap the main component with the `<SessionProvider>`.
  5.  **Create Sign-In/Out UI:** Add login and logout buttons that use the `signIn()` and `signOut()` methods from `next-auth/react`.
  6.  **Extend Data Model:** Add a `User` table to the database schema (`id`, `name`, `email`, `image`) to store user profiles.

### Phase 3: Authorization - Permissions & Sharing
Once users exist, we need to control what they can see and do.

- **[ ] Data Model for Permissions:**
  - **Goal:** Define relationships between users, boards, and their roles.
  - **Implementation:** Create a new "join table" in the database schema called `BoardMember`.
  - **Schema:** `BoardMember { id: string, boardId: string, userId: string, role: 'owner' | 'editor' | 'viewer' }`. This table links a user to a board with a specific role.

- **[ ] API-Level Access Control:**
  - **Goal:** Ensure every action is authorized on the (future) backend.
  - **Implementation:** Before any database operation (e.g., `updateCard`), create helper functions that check the user's role from the `BoardMember` table. For example: `const userRole = await getUserRole(userId, boardId); if (userRole !== 'owner' && userRole !== 'editor') { throw new Error("Unauthorized"); }`.

- **[ ] Board Sharing UI:**
  - **Goal:** Allow board owners to invite other users.
  - **Implementation:** Create a "Share" button on the board that opens a dialog. The dialog will allow the owner to enter another user's email, select a role, and add them to the `BoardMember` table for that board.

### Phase 4: Securing the Cloud Infrastructure (Future)
When data moves from local-only to a cloud database.

- **[ ] Secure Secrets Management:**
  - **Goal:** Never commit sensitive credentials (API keys, database URLs, OAuth secrets) to Git.
  - **Implementation:** Use the environment variable management provided by your hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify). Store all secrets there. For local development, use a `.env.local` file, which is already in your `.gitignore`.

- **[ ] Secure Database Connection:**
  - **Goal:** Ensure data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
  - **Implementation:** Use a managed database provider (e.g., Vercel Postgres, Supabase) that enforces SSL/TLS connections by default and encrypts data at rest.

- **[ ] API Hardening:**
  - **Goal:** Protect public-facing API endpoints from abuse.
  - **Implementation:**
    - **JWT Validation:** On every API request, validate the JWT provided by NextAuth.js to authenticate the user.
    - **Rate Limiting:** Use a library like `express-rate-limit` or Vercel's built-in helpers to prevent brute-force attacks.
    - **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in `next.config.ts` to only allow requests from your application's domain.

## Recent Architectural Improvements

### Adaptive Card Height System
The card component now intelligently adjusts its visual density based on content:
- **Compact Mode**: Triggered when card has minimal content (title only or single metadata)
- **Dynamic Padding**: Reduces from `p-2.5` to `p-1.5` for compact cards
- **Border Width**: Reduces from `border-l-4` to `border-l-2` for compact cards
- **Inline Metadata**: Single metadata items display inline next to title

### LabelPopoverCompact Component
A unified label management interface that replaces the previous multi-component approach:
- **Single Popover**: Search, create, edit, and delete all in one place
- **Color Picker**: Integrated 12-color palette for label customization
- **Search Filter**: Quick label search functionality
- **Edit Mode**: Click edit icon to modify existing labels inline
- **Reduced Clicks**: Streamlined workflow improves efficiency

### Inline Metadata Display
Smart layout decisions for cleaner card appearance:
- **Single Due Date**: Shows inline with color-coded background
- **Single Checklist**: Shows progress dots or bar inline
- **Single Assignee Set**: Shows avatars inline (up to 3 visible)
- **Multiple Metadata**: Falls back to traditional stacked layout
